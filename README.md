# OffSec AI Mentor

## 🎯 Project Overview

**OffSec AI Mentor** is a production-ready, AI-powered learning guidance tool for offensive security learners. It helps users:

- **Assess** their current cybersecurity skill level with dynamic, AI-generated questions
- **Evaluate** their strengths and weaknesses objectively
- **Choose** a target OffSec certification (OSCP, OSEP, OSWE, OSED, OSCE³, OSEE)
- **Receive** a personalized, phase-based learning roadmap aligned with their chosen cert
- **Discuss** learning goals, mindset, and strategy with a guided, constrained mentor AI
- **Export** their roadmap for offline study

This is an **educational guidance tool only**—not a hacking tutorial, not a vulnerability scanner, not a penetration testing platform. It mentors learners toward ethical offensive security mastery.

   cd OffSec-AI-Mentor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure your API key:**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` and add your API key (choose one):
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Groq (Recommended - Free)
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   
   # Option 2: OpenAI
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

   **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** 
   - Never commit your `.env` file to git
   - The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`
   - Multiple API keys enable automatic fallback

4. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # Or for development with auto-reload:
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open in browser:**
   ```

## 🛡️ Robust Error Handling & Fallback System

### **Assessment Generation (Always Works)**
The application ensures assessments **never fail** for users:

1. **Primary:** Attempts to generate questions using AI API
2. **Fallback:** If AI fails (network error, rate limit, invalid key):
   - Automatically switches to **predefined fallback questions**
   - User never sees an error
   - Questions are still varied and educational
   - Covers all core topics (Linux, networking, web security, etc.)

**Fallback Questions:**
- 10 questions for beginner mode
- 10 questions for OSCP mode
- Mix of multiple-choice and short-answer
- High-quality, manually curated content

### **Roadmap Generation (AI-Only)**
Roadmaps **must** be generated by AI for personalization:

1. **Primary:** Calls AI API with assessment results
2. **Retry:** Automatically retries once on failure (with 1s delay)
3. **Friendly Error:** If all retries fail, shows user-friendly message:
   - "AI is taking longer than expected. Please try again."
   - No technical error details exposed
   - Clear "Try Again" button

**During Generation:**
- ETA countdown (15-25 seconds)
- Rotating developer jokes for entertainment
- Smooth loading animations

### **Developer Jokes Examples**
```
🔧 75% of bugs are fixed by checking the API key...
🚀 If it works on localhost, it's production ready, right?
🎯 Generating roadmap... responsibly hacking knowledge...
🔑 Blaming the API key in 3...2...1...
🤖 Teaching AI about responsible disclosure...
```

Accent:    #ffd60a (yellow)      — Warnings, important notes
Success:   #06d6a0 (green)       — Positive feedback
Black:     #000000 (black)       — Text, borders
White:     #ffffff (white)       — Backgrounds, contrast
```

### **Animations**
- Scroll-reveal (AOS): fade-up, slide-in
- Button feedback: translate on hover/click, shadow
- Chat bubbles: slide-in from sides
- Progress bar: smooth width transition
- Roadmap phases: staggered reveal
- **All animations are subtle and purposeful**

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### **API Key Security**
- ✅ **Never hardcode API keys** in source code
- ✅ **Always use environment variables** (`.env` file)
- ✅ **Keep `.env` in `.gitignore`** (prevents accidental commits)
- ✅ **Rotate keys regularly** for production use
- ✅ **Backend-only exposure** — API keys never sent to frontend

### **Previous Security Issue (Fixed)**
Earlier versions had hardcoded API keys in:
- `server.js` (line 35) ❌ **FIXED**
- `app.py` (line 313) ❌ **FIXED**
- `app-new.js` (line 10) ❌ **FIXED**

**All hardcoded keys have been removed** and replaced with environment variable loading.

### **Data & Privacy**
- ✅ User data stored locally in SQLite database
- ✅ Passwords hashed with bcryptjs
- ✅ Session-based authentication
- ✅ No external data sharing
- ✅ All AI calls go to respective providers (check their privacy policies)

### **For Production Deployment:**
1. Use environment variables on hosting platform (Vercel, Railway, etc.)
2. Enable HTTPS/SSL
3. Set secure CORS policies
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Monitor API usage and costs
6. Never expose `.env` files publicly
