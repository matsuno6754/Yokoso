## How the Features Work

### 1. Skill Assessment 🎯

**User Journey:**
1. User clicks "Start Skill Assessment"
2. AI asks first question (from SKILL_ASSESSMENT_PROMPT)
3. User answers in chat interface
4. AI asks follow-up questions (tracking in session history)
5. After ~10 questions, AI provides:
   - Skill level (Beginner/Foundation/Intermediate)
   - Strengths and weaknesses
   - Learning recommendations

**Technical Flow:**
```python
User clicks button → 
initialize conversation with SKILL_ASSESSMENT_PROMPT →
call_openai() with system prompt + user message →
Store in session_state.skill_assessment_history →
Display in chat interface →
Continue conversation until assessment complete →
Store results in session_state.skill_results
```

### 2. Learning Roadmap 🗺️

**User Journey:**
1. Completes skill assessment first
2. Clicks "Generate My Learning Roadmap"
3. AI analyzes assessment results
4. Generates personalized plan with:
   - Prioritized topics
   - Recommended tools
   - Practice platforms
   - Timeline and milestones

**Technical Flow:**
```python
Check if skill_results exists →
Generate prompt with LEARNING_ROADMAP_PROMPT + assessment results →
call_openai() →
Display formatted roadmap →
Store in session_state.roadmap_generated
```

### 3. Enumeration Coach 🔍

**User Journey:**
1. User pastes scan output (e.g., Nmap)
2. Optionally adds context
3. Clicks "Analyze Scan Results"
4. AI explains:
   - What each service means
   - What to enumerate next
   - Why those steps matter
   - Methodology behind decisions

**Technical Flow:**
```python
User pastes scan output into text_area →
User clicks analyze button →
Construct prompt with ENUMERATION_COACH_PROMPT + scan output →
call_openai() →
Display analysis results
```

**Important:** AI does NOT provide exploit commands - only methodology

### 4. Pentest Report Helper 📝

**User Journey:**
1. User describes a finding
2. Selects severity and type
3. Clicks "Generate Report Section"
4. AI formats into professional report:
   - Executive summary
   - Technical description
   - Risk assessment
   - Remediation guidance

**Technical Flow:**
```python
User fills in finding details →
User clicks generate button →
Construct prompt with REPORT_HELPER_PROMPT + finding details →
call_openai() →
Display formatted report section
```

## How AI Prompting Works

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

Each AI interaction uses a **system prompt** + **user message**:

```
System Prompt (defines behavior):
"You are a senior pentester mentor..."
+ Ethical constraints
+ Feature-specific instructions
+ Learning mode modifications

User Message (actual request):
"Here's my Nmap scan: [scan output]"
or
"Please assess my skills by asking questions"
```

### Ethical Constraints Enforcement

**Implemented in prompts:**
```python
CRITICAL RULES:
- You are an EDUCATOR, not a tool operator
- Never provide exploit code or payloads
- Never give step-by-step attack commands
- Focus on methodology and reasoning
```

**How it works:**
- OpenAI models follow system instructions
- Constraints repeated in every prompt
- Feature-specific reinforcement
- AI trained to refuse harmful requests

### Learning Mode System

**Modifies teaching style:**
```python
Beginner Mode: "Provide detailed explanations with examples"
OSCP Mode: "Focus on hints, encourage 'Try Harder'"
Red Team Mode: "Emphasize OPSEC and professional methodology"
```

## Session State Management

**What is Session State?**
Streamlit's way to remember data across page refreshes/interactions.

**What We Store:**
```python
st.session_state = {
    'skill_assessment_history': [],     # Conversation messages
    'skill_results': None,              # Assessment outcome
    'roadmap_generated': False,         # Generated roadmap
    'learning_mode': 'Beginner Mode'    # Current mode
}
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Maintains conversation continuity
- Enables multi-step features
- Preserves user progress
- Allows feature interdependence (assessment → roadmap)

## API Communication

### How OpenAI Integration Works

```python
def call_openai(system_prompt, user_message, conversation_history=None):
    # Build message array
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        # ... conversation history ...
        {"role": "user", "content": user_message}
    ]
    
    # Call API
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model=OPENAI_MODEL,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0.7,      # Creativity level
        max_tokens=2000       # Response length limit
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

**Parameters Explained:**
- **model**: Which AI model to use (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5)
- **messages**: Conversation context
- **temperature**: 0.7 = balanced creativity and consistency
- **max_tokens**: Limits response length (cost control)

### Error Handling

```python
try:
    # API call
except openai.AuthenticationError:
    return "Check your API key"
except openai.RateLimitError:
    return "Too many requests, wait a moment"
except Exception as e:
    return f"Error: {str(e)}"
```

## Security & Privacy

### What's Protected:
- ✅ API key stored in `.env` (not committed to git)
- ✅ No persistent storage of conversations
- ✅ Session data cleared when browser closes
- ✅ Ethical constraints prevent harmful outputs

### What's Shared:
- ⚠️ User messages sent to OpenAI API
- ⚠️ Scan outputs included in API calls
- ℹ️ Review OpenAI's privacy policy

### Best Practices:
- Don't paste real production scan data
- Don't include actual credentials in examples
- Use practice/lab environments only

## Customization Options

### Changing AI Model

In `.env`:
```env
# Budget-friendly, faster
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo

# Better quality, slower, more expensive
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4

# Latest GPT-4 Turbo
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo-preview
```

### Modifying Prompts

Edit `prompts.py`:
```python
# Add new constraint
ENUMERATION_COACH_PROMPT = BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT + """
...existing prompt...

NEW RULE: Always mention OPSEC considerations
"""
```

### Adding New Features

1. Create new prompt in `prompts.py`
2. Add new tab in `app.py`:
   ```python
   def new_feature_tab():
       st.markdown("## New Feature")
       # Implementation
   
   # In main():
   tab5 = st.tabs(["...", "New Feature"])
   with tab5:
       new_feature_tab()
   ```

### Styling Changes

Modify CSS in `app.py`:
```python
st.markdown("""
    <style>
    .main-header {
        color: #YOUR_COLOR;
    }
    </style>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

## Testing Your Application

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Installation Test:**
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   # Should install and launch successfully
   ```

2. **API Connection Test:**
   - Check sidebar for "✅ API Key Configured"
   - Try skill assessment with one question
   - Verify you get a response

3. **Feature Tests:**
   - Skill Assessment: Complete 2-3 questions
   - Roadmap: Generate after assessment
   - Enumeration: Paste example Nmap output
   - Report: Create one sample finding

4. **Error Handling:**
